title:  "DOSE: Elevating Your Mood & Mindset Through Science"
---

Earlier today, I attended a fascinating workshop by TJ Power that dived deep into the science of happiness and motivation—through the lens of DOSE. For the uninitiated, DOSE stands for Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin, and Endorphins. These are the four key neurochemicals that significantly influence our mood, motivation, and overall sense of well-being.

The session began with an engaging activity using Mentimeter, where we were prompted to rate our DOSE levels in real-time. It was a brilliant way to check in with ourselves and reflect on how we were feeling in the moment. Here's what we explored and the key takeaways:

---

### **1. Dopamine: The Motivator 💪**

Dopamine is the reward chemical that fuels our drive and ambition. It’s what makes you feel accomplished after ticking off a task or achieving a goal. However, it’s also the one that gets hijacked by social media likes and quick dopamine hits.

**Key Insight:** To harness dopamine effectively, focus on _delayed gratification_. TJ suggested replacing quick fixes (like endlessly scrolling Instagram) with small, achievable goals that build toward something meaningful. For instance:

- Break larger projects into bite-sized tasks.
- Celebrate micro-wins to keep the motivation alive.

### **2. Oxytocin: The Connector 🙋🏻‍♀️**

Often referred to as the "love hormone," oxytocin is released when we feel connected to others. It’s that warm fuzzy feeling you get during a hug or when someone genuinely listens to you.

**Key Insight:** Building connection in the digital age requires intentionality. TJ recommended prioritising face-to-face interactions over virtual ones whenever possible. Some actionable steps:

- Practise active listening in conversations.
- Engage in acts of kindness, as they trigger oxytocin release for both the giver and receiver.

### **3. Serotonin: The Energiser 🔋**

Serotonin plays a pivotal role in regulating our mood and energy levels. It’s deeply connected to our sense of significance and belonging, often dipping when we compare ourselves to others.

**Key Insight:** Gratitude is a serotonin booster. TJ encouraged us to spend a few minutes daily reflecting on things we’re grateful for. Additionally:

- Get outside in natural sunlight—it’s a proven way to increase serotonin levels.
- Incorporate mindfulness practices to stay grounded and energised.

### **4. Endorphins: The Relaxer 😌**

Endorphins are our natural painkillers, providing relief and a sense of calm. They’re released during physical activity or moments of laughter and joy.

**Key Insight:** You don’t have to run a marathon to boost endorphins. Simple actions like:

- A quick burst of exercise (even a 10-minute walk),
- Watching a funny video, or
- Practising deep breathing can do wonders.

### **Takeaways from the Mentimeter Activity**

The real-time Mentimeter poll helped us visualise our DOSE levels and pinpoint areas needing attention. It was fascinating to see how interconnected these neurochemicals are—sometimes a boost in one naturally elevates the others. For example:

- Connecting with a friend (oxytocin) might motivate you to tackle a task (dopamine).
- A brisk walk (endorphins) in sunlight (serotonin) can significantly uplift your mood.

### **The Power of Awareness**

TJ Power’s workshop reminded me that maintaining a balanced DOSE is less about radical changes and more about consistent, small actions. By becoming aware of these neurochemical levers, we can take charge of our mental well-being and create a life filled with purpose, connection, and joy.

So, how are your DOSE levels today? Let this be your gentle reminder to check in, take small steps, and make the science of happiness work for you.
