# Quarterly/Annual Goal Check-in

I joined the productivity lab on 2024-09-21, so today (2024-01-06) marks **Day 108** of my transformation journey, and I’d like to celebrate in **three key areas of life** that have seen the most growth:

💪 **Health:**  
After a decade, I finally hired a personal trainer and have consistently had an average **3 daily sessions** at 07:30 am (UK time). I’ve done my research and bought a high-quality treadmill/walking desk for my living room around Black Friday. Along with tracking my diet more regularly on MyFitnessPal, I’ve been sneaking in yoga poses and Wing Chun punches during conference calls when I can turn off my camera! 🧘‍♂️🥋

🧠 **Work (Research):**  
I’m pursuing a PhD in Computational Psychology as a **side hobby** and have made great progress preparing for a **large-scale study** which started late October, the results came in well and my team aspires to publish in an Elsevier journal . My productivity and focus have surged thanks to FR-OAR (Focus-Reflect-Organise-Align-Recharge), allowing me to help my research team implement features at **lightning speed**. ⚡

💼 **Work (Corporate):**  
At my full-time job in fintech at a UK bank HQ, my focus on FR-OAR has had a huge impact. I’ve spent more time organizing and planning rather than blindly doing tasks, leading to skyrocketing productivity. I have also developed much more discipline in using Spaced Repetition, Active Recall and Memory Palaces to learn highly complex systems more effectively. This push is helping me accelerate towards financial independence, which feels more within reach! 💸💼

💼 **Work (Psychotherapy):**  
- started fourth and final year of my BACP-approved psychotherapy training 
- starting volunteering at Mind South East London 
- did training at Hoarding UK for eventual volunteering with them in 2025/2026

💼 **Work (Entrepreneurial):**  
- helping a dear friend of mine to prepare the launch of fithub360.com 

🌐 **Connection (Friendship & Family):**

- **Friendship**: I attended a London Meetup organised by Celine on Day 07 and made wonderful connections. I even discovered another alchemist who lives within a 30-minute brisk walk from my house! I met another alchemist (Hannah) on Day 16. I co-worked in person with another alchemist (Jonathan) and attended another in-person event in November. I organised a joyful Christmas dinner and three other alchemists turned up. I also think I have fostered two friendship in the NVC circle.
- Plus, I’ve hosted 30 plus Lab Socials so far and have started brewing meaningful friendships. 🤝
- **Family**: I’ve been consciously applying Nonviolent Communication (NVC) with my parents, sister, and wife, and I can feel the relationships levelling up. The deeper connection is truly noticeable. 💖
 
🧘‍♂️ **Connection (Spiritual):**  
I hired a very affordable meditation teacher to make my practice easier and more regular. This focus on spirituality has brought me more inner peace and clarity. I guided more than five new participants to my spiritual community, RKUK (RKUK.org) and two became members. 

🎉 **Fun:**  
- I absolutely adore learning languages! I hired a Hindi teacher, and instead of (re) learning the basics like “where is the post office?”, I prepared to to discuss **FR-OAR** concepts. 😉 It’s so satisfying to align language learning with my life goals. This Hindi didn't last long since it ended up using more resources than I expected. 
- I prepared for Japanese N2 exam and took it on 1st December; I'm confident that I have passed. I aspire to pass N1 in 2026 if not 2025. 😉
- I had an amazing trip with my wife to Budapest, Madrid, Cadiz 

In just **108 days**, the transformation has been incredible. I’m excited to see how far I can go by day 180, 365… 🌟

🎉 **Highest:**

In the past few months, I’ve made significant strides toward empowering a couple of communities around Lake Victoria in Kenya through a project close to my heart. This initiative focuses on three transformative pillars:

1. **Education**:
    - I’m supporting the completion of the NVC School Rusinga, with only ~$9,000 USD remaining to fund the roof. This school is designed to empower young minds through a curriculum rooted in empathy and Nonviolent Communication (NVC).
    - Additionally, I’m establishing a parallel program to introduce NVC training in surrounding schools, creating ripple effects in fostering connection and understanding.
2. **Menstrual Health and Dignity**:
    - My team is planning a program offering menstrual cups and sanitary pads to selected schoolgirls, providing not just physical resources but also holistic family and community support. This initiative ensures these young women can pursue their education uninterrupted, with dignity and confidence.
3. **Community Resilience**:
    - With my partners, I’ve worked on building family and community networks that prioritise emotional well-being and sustainable growth. This includes workshops and dialogues that deepen the impact of NVC and align with the region's cultural context.

I’m grateful for the profound lessons learned, the connections formed, and the small yet significant steps toward building a resilient and compassionate community. I envision this venture as a cornerstone of a broader mission to empower underprivileged groups globally. 🌍

🙏 **Gratitude** to Ali, his team, and my fellow alchemists for all the support. Onwards to a more wonderful life! 😇
